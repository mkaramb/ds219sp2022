This video explains how open source software powers some of the biggest companies on the planet and goes into why giving away software for free is a viable business model.
I learned that this free software is maintained by random people working as unpaid volunteers to senior engineers at huge tech companies. 
Very interesting and informative video would definitely recommend.
